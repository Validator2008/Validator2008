            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    After 25+ years in technology, I’ve learned that systems rarely fall over because they’re too
                    complex – they fall over because humans made them that way. I’ve spent my career leading
                    engineering organizations through hyper-growth, transformation, and “this really shouldn’t be down”
                    moments, turning chaos into scalable platforms, sane processes, and teams that actually enjoy
                    shipping.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today, I lead engineering at <strong>Redcare Pharmacy</strong>, where 170+ engineers keep Europe’s largest
                    e-pharmacy running across eRX, webshop, apps, payments, and multi-country operations. Think hundreds
                    of thousands of daily orders, complex regulation, and zero tolerance for downtime. My focus: build
                    resilient platforms, raise engineering standards, and make sure quality and reliability are owned by
                    teams – not thrown over the wall to someone else.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before this, I was <strong>CTO at Codility</strong>, steering the company through a market downturn, 
                    a refinancing, and a tech transformation—simultaneously increasing release velocity and keeping customer 
                    satisfaction above 95%. I also cut AWS costs by 45% in four months, which confused enough people that I 
                    had to assure them nothing important had been unplugged. Acting as interim Head of Product, I helped teams 
                    ship more in one quarter than they had in the previous year. Turns out clarity, discovery, and outcome 
                    focus work wonders.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before that, I built and scaled platform, infrastructure, SRE, and quality organizations at companies
                    like <strong>Getir</strong>, <strong>HelloFresh</strong>, and <strong>RSA Security</strong>. From turning infrastructure into a
                    self-service developer platform, to reducing MTTR below 40 minutes, to saving hundreds of thousands
                    per month in cloud costs, the theme has been consistent: make systems robust, teams effective, and
                    investments in technology actually pay off.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My philosophy is straightforward: engineering is a strategic asset, not a cost center. Great teams
                    outperform great processes. And the job of technology leadership is to create clarity, remove noise,
                    and build organizations capable of solving tomorrow’s problems – not just firefighting today’s.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you’re dealing with scale, complexity, legacy platforms, or organizational growing pains – and
                    you’re looking for someone who will bring experience, challenge your assumptions, and stay focused on
                    outcomes – we should talk. I’m particularly interested in collaborations around platform strategy,
                    org design, engineering excellence, and making technology a genuine competitive advantage rather than
                    an expensive liability.
                </p>
